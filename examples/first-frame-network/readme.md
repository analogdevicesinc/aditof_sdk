# first-frame-network sample code

## Overview

The first-frame-network is a cross platform sample code that shows how to use the aditof sdk to talk to a remote ToF camera over the network.

For example if the ip address of the target is `192.168.1.110` the run command should be:
`./first-frame-network "192.168.1.110"`
