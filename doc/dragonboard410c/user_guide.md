# DragonBoard410c User guide

## Setting up the system

### Required hardware
- [AD-96TOF1-EBZ development kit](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ad-96tof1-ebz.html)
- [DragonBoard410c](https://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/)
- DragonBoard410c 12V power supply (e.g. AK-ND-49)
- To run the system in standalone mode, besides the accessories that are provided in the AD-96TOF1-EBZ box you'll need an additional HDMI cable to connect to a monitor and a USB keyboard and mouse

### Power on sequence
- plug the SD card that came in the AD-96TOF1-EBZ box into the DragonBoard410c SD card slot. To benefit from the most recent software updates it is highly recommended to update the SD card with the [latest SD card image](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/aditof_sdk#supported-embedded-platforms)
- Make sure that switch S6 on the DragonBoard410C is set to SD BOOT (position 2 ON, all others OFF)
- connect the HDMI cable from the monitor to the DragonBoard410c HDMI connector
- connect a USB mouse and keyboard to the DragonBoard410c. It's possible to use either a mouse & keyboard combo or a separate mouse and keyboard
- connect the 5V power supply to the camera board and set the camera power switch S2 to on. Once the camera board is powered up the DS1 LED will turn on
- connect the 12V power supply to the DragonBoard 410c. Once power is connected to the DragonBoard the system will boot the Linux OS from the SD card.

### Power off sequence
- under Linux open a terminal and type ***sudo poweroff***. This will safely power off the DragonBoard410c and ensure that the SD card is properly umounted
- remove the 12V supply from the DragonBoard410c
- set the camera board power switch to off

### Troubleshooting
- Linux does not boot
  - Sometimes the SD card is not read correctly and this prevents the system to boot. Reset the system by removing and reapplying power to the DragonBoard410c
  - The SD card is corrupted and this prevents the system from booting. Reflash the SD card with the SD card image.
- The DragonBoard410c restarts after running the ***sudo poweroff*** command
  - This is a frequent issue that prevents the DragonBoard410c to be safely powered off and can lead to the corruption of the SD card. The simplest workaround to avoid SD card corruption is to remove the SD card while the system is running and then remove power from the DragonBoard410c. The other option is to watch carefully the system power state after running the poweroff command and immediately after seeing that all the LEDs on the DragonBoard410c have turned off remove the power from the DragonBoard.

## Running the evaluation application

Once Linux boots you'll see on the HDMI monitor the Linux desktop and on the top left corner a shortcut to the evaluation application. Double clicking on the icon will start the evaluation application.  A console window will open to show the application's status and, after a few seconds, the evaluation application GUI will be displayed. 

![aditof-demo](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/aditof_sdk/blob/master/doc/img/aditof_demo.png)

The evaluation application allows to do live streaming of depth and IR data as well as recording the depth and IR data and playing back from a file. The depth data is displayed as a color map ranging from warm to cold colors as the distance from the camera increases. A point in the middle of the depth image shows the distance in mm to the target.

There are 3 operating modes that determine the range of the system:
 - Near - 25cm to 80cm
 - Medium - 30cm to 4.5m (Rev.B: 80cm to 3m)
 - Far - 300cm to 600cm

When in a certain operating mode the system will measure distances outside of the mode's range but those will not be accurate. 
 
The evaluation application also displays the temperature in deg C of the camera (AFE) and laser boards as read from the temperature sensors installed on each board.

The framerate at which data is acquired from the system is constantly updated on the GUI. The camera board outputs data at 30 frames per second (fps), but due to system load the evaluation application processes the frames at a lower rate.

### Note
 - Use the custom X button which is under the title bar on the top-right side to close the application. Otherwise the application will hang.

### Troubleshooting
- The demo application hangs after closing the main window
  - Due to some limitations the application always hangs if it is closed using the regular X button from the window top bar (title bar). To avoid this unpleasant hang, we've made available a second X button in the top right corner right above the title bar that can be used to safely close the demo application. We hope this to be a temporary workaround.

## Building the SDK

### SDK dependencies
To build the SDK and run the included applications and example code the following dependencies must be installed in the system:
 - v4l-utils
 - libopencv-dev
 - cmake
 - glog v0.3.5
 - libwebsockets v3.1
 - protocol buffers v3.9.0
 
The SD card image already contains all the SDK dependencies and there's no need to install them again. To update and build the SDK just follow the steps below.

```console
linaro@linaro-alip:~/workspace/github/aditof_sdk$ git pull
linaro@linaro-alip:~/workspace/github/aditof_sdk$ cd build
linaro@linaro-alip:~/workspace/github/aditof_sdk/build$ cmake -DDRAGONBOARD=1 ..
linaro@linaro-alip:~/workspace/github/aditof_sdk/build$ make -j4
``` 
***Note:*** if the above commands return permission errors try running them as *sudo*

## Linux Kernel
A customized [Linaro kernel](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/aditof_linux) is provided for the DragonBoard410c including the [V4L2 driver for the ADDI903x](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/aditof_linux/blob/d3/release/ov5640_4.9.27/drivers/media/i2c/addi903x.c) and other improvements to support all the ADI depth camera features.
