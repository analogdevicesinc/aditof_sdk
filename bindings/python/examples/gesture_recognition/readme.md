# 3D Time of Flight : Python Challenge

### Overview

The gesture recognition example offers a GUI to load and process depth images
acquired from a 3D ToF camera. 
For this challenge, participants will have to improve the finger detection algorithm in 
order to obtain valid results on all given cases. These are the 6 images in this
directory. 

### Instructions 
Open the gesture_recognition directory in a terminal window or in a Python IDE of your choice.
First, make sure all the required python packages are installed. To do this, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To open the application, run the python script process.py.
Click the "Load" button to open an image and the "Process" button to apply the
finger detection algorithm to it. 

The functions that handle the algorithm are the following: 
 * _detect_hand() - line 89
 * _count_fingers() - line 103

Participants will have to edit these two in order to modify the algorithm.

### Submissions

To submit your results, please archive the gesture_recognition directory and send 
us the .zip file, with the subject: "3D ToF Python Challenge"
